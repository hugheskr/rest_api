#Heroes_vs_Villains

##Description

-Heroes_vs_Villains is a single page app that allows users to add, edit, and remove their favorite heroes and villains from two separate lists/resources.

-Technologies used include Angular, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express, and Mongoose/MongoDB. Testing was completed using Gulp, Mocha, and Chai.

-I am the sole contributor to this repository. I used custom Angular directives, controllers, and services to make a dynamic front end which updates my MongoDB back end through an Express server.
